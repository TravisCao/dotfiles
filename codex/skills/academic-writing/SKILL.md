# Academic Writing Assistant

This skill helps write academic papers for power systems and quantum computing research.

## How to Use This Skill

**For different sections, read the appropriate reference file:**

- **Abstract writing** → Read `references/abstract-writing.md`
- **Introduction writing** → Read `references/introduction-writing.md` (includes literature review workflow)
- **Methodology writing** → Read `references/methodology-writing.md`
- **Case study/results** → Read `references/case-study-writing.md`
- **Conclusion** → Read `references/conclusion-writing.md`

**Always apply** → Read `references/common-style-rules.md` for universal writing guidelines

## Critical Reminders

1. **Abbreviations**: First use MUST be "Full Term (ABBR)", then use "ABBR" consistently
2. **No literature fabrication**: Use web_search for citations, never invent authors/years/venues
3. **Gap-literature alignment**: Gap statements must directly follow from specific literature limitations
4. **Style check**: Before finalizing, verify against common-style-rules.md
